# TODO App Features

## Key Features

- **Task Addition:**- Tasks can be effortlessly added using the input bar by simply pressing the return key.



- **Task List** - A dynamic list of tasks is maintained, where tasks appear as cards. These are appended to the list as soon as they are created.

- **Task Completion**- Upon clicking a task card, the task is marked as complete. Completed tasks are then automatically relocated to the bottom of the list.

- **Ordering**- Active tasks are consistently displayed in the sequence of their creation. Conversely, completed tasks are organized based on their completion time.

- **Reset Functionality**- For convenience, a reset button is included. This button facilitates the clearing of all tasks, effectively resetting the app to its initial, pristine state.

- **Persistence**- The app is designed to maintain its state even through browser refreshes, emulating the reliability of a native offline application.


<h3>Task Editing(Additional Feature)</h3>
<li style="font-size: large;">

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
